I'll have to learn more on CSS and master it very well before I move on to Javascript and other languages.

### Useful resources

- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
